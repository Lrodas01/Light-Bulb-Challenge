<div class = "name"> Luis Rodas </div> <div class = "hobby"> One of my hobbies is playing videogames. I usually play them with my freinds afterschool or over the weekend, but that's if the game they are playing interests me. I enjoy war sims, fps, and strategy games, and everynow and then, a horror game. More specifically, I enjoy playing Ready or Not, War Thunder, and a few games on Roblox. Although, it can be a bad habit as it has caused me to procrastinate or even not do my assignments. I am also interested on how developers make their games work, especially the ones I play, and would like to know how to make one myself. </div>
